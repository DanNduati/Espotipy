Frequently Asked Questions
Accessing your data without showing a login form
I want to interact with the web API and show some data on my website. I see that the endpoints I require authorization, but I donâ€™t need/want a login window to pop-up, because I want to grant my own app access to my own playlists once. Is there any way of doing this?
You basically need an access token and a refresh token issued for your user account. To obtain a pair of access token - refresh token, follow the Authorization Code Flow (if you need a certain scope to be approved) or Client Credentials (if you just need to sign your request, like when fetching a certain playlist). Once you obtain them, you can use your access token and refresh it when it expires without having to show any login form.
