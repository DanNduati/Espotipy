Frequently Asked Questions
Accessing your data without showing a login form
I want to interact with the web API and show some data on my 
website. I see that the endpoints I require authorization,
but I donâ€™t need/want a login window to pop-up, because I 
want to grant my own app access to my own playlists once. 
Is there any way of doing this?
You basically need an access token and a refresh token issued 
for your user account. To obtain a pair of access token - refresh token,
 follow the Authorization Code Flow (if you need a certain scope to be approved)
or Client Credentials (if you just need to sign your request, like when fetching a certain playlist). 
Once you obtain them, you can use your access token and refresh 
it when it expires without having to show any login form.

1. Authorization Code Flow
 The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access
   tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for confidential clients.
   Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of
   interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web
   browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
   from the authorization server.
