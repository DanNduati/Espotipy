This is my personal breakdown of what youll find at : https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/
1. Setup an account : 
	-> To use the Web API, start by creating a Spotify user account (Premium or Free).
	   To do that, simply sign up at www.spotify.com.
2. Register your application : 
	-> Any application can request data from Spotify Web API endpoints 
	and many endpoints are open and will return data without requiring registration.
	However, if your application seeks access to a userâ€™s personal data (profile, playlists, etc.)
	it must be registered. Registered applications also get other benefits, like higher rate limits at some endpoints.
	You can register your application, even before you have created it.

3. Create your app
https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples

The app uses the Authorization code flow which is as follows:
1. Have the application request authorization - this requires the user to login and authorize access
2. Have your application request refresh and access tokens; Spotify returns access and refresh tokens
3. Add a route to send auth token to external devices
